                name: 'The Last Of Us',
                description: 'In the wake of a blockbuster sequel and a TV adaptation that shattered expectations, it’s hard to believe that The Last Of Us debuted on the PlayStation 3 a decade ago. Even then though, the impact of Naughty Dog\'s post-apocalyptic epic was Earth-shattering for players and rival developers alike. From its gut-wrenching prelude that can still emotionally eviscerate you more powerfully than the opening montage of Pixar’s Up, this was a game that you never wanted to end, even as it shook you to your soul; a fallen, ruined world that you genuinely cared about. With more 10/10 reviews than you can shake a makeshift shiv at, it scored highly in all aspects: combat, crafting, acting, script, sound design, art design, graphics and more. But it was its story and its characters that really set The Last Of Us apart: the relationship between Joel, a grizzled zombie apocalypse survivor, and Ellie, his teenage ward, forming an emotional core that left you in tears come the story\'s endlessly talked-about finale.',

                name: 'The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild',
                description: 'The Wii U’s swansong and the Switch’s dawn chorus, Breath of the Wild was the biggest gamble Nintendo had taken with The Legend Of Zelda since Ocarina Of Time. Taking Link’s adventures into an open world environment was as big a shift as Ocarina’s leap into the third dimension, one that required changing everything from environmental navigation to narrative progression to the clothes on Link’s back. The pay-off was worth it though, resulting in the most stunningly realised version of Hyrule ever created, and the unfettered freedom to explore it however you liked. Want to run straight to confront Calamity Ganon armed with nothing more than a stick? You can. Want to go climb that mountain? You can. Want to unearth every secret the blighted land holds? You can do that too. Sure, Tears Of The Kingdom may have polished every aspect of the game to an even higher sheen, but it’s Breath of the Wild that provided the gems to polish. Hands down, the greatest accomplishment in a series already known for its greatness.',

                description: 'The Dark Souls games are rightly held up as a landmark in gaming history, but they all seem like mere prelude to the force of nature that is Elden Ring. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki took everything he’d learned in the creation of Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro, and applied it to FromSoftware’s biggest game ever. It was a risk — would the light-touch storytelling, challenging combat, and detailed but proscriptive settings of the developer’s earlier works translate to an open world? As soon as you step out onto the gorgeous yet bleak plains of Limgrave and begin to explore the Lands Between, you realise the answer is a resounding “YES!” Combat is a delight, character builds are endlessly customisable, and the land itself is positively crammed with secrets that players are still discovering. An absolute juggernaut of a title, and one that deserves its near-instant legendary reputation.',
